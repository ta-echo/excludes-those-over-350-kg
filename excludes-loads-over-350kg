//You
//Write a program in PHP that excludes loads over 350 kg.
//ChatGPT
//Certainly! Below is a simple example of a PHP program that filters loads and excludes those over 350 kg:

// Sample array of loads with weights
$loads = array(
    array("item" => "Box 1", "weight" => 300),
    array("item" => "Box 2", "weight" => 400),
    array("item" => "Box 3", "weight" => 250),
    array("item" => "Box 4", "weight" => 380),
    array("item" => "Box 5", "weight" => 320)
);

// Function to filter loads based on weight
function filterLoads($loads, $maxWeight) {
    $filteredLoads = array();
    
    foreach ($loads as $load) {
        if ($load['weight'] <= $maxWeight) {
            $filteredLoads[] = $load;
        }
    }

    return $filteredLoads;
}

// Maximum weight limit (350 kg)
$maxWeightLimit = 350;

// Filter loads
$filteredLoads = filterLoads($loads, $maxWeightLimit);

// Display the original and filtered loads
echo "Original Loads:\n";
print_r($loads);

echo "\nFiltered Loads (excluding loads over $maxWeightLimit kg):\n";
print_r($filteredLoads);

?>
